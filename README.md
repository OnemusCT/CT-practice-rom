# Chrono Trigger Speedrun practice ROM Hack
An IPS patch for SNES Chrono Trigger to create a version of the ROM with cutscenes removed

The current focus is on the Any% speedrun route and associated cutscenes. This is mostly done through getting Robo although it has not been thoroughly tested.

To use this patch you will need an unaltered Chrono Trigger SNES ROM and a patching utility such as [Lunar IPS](https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/). In Lunar IPS select `Apply IPS Patch`, then select the downloaded patch and the file to patch
> Note: Lunar IPS will overwrite the original ROM, so make a copy if you want to keep the original ROM as well.
